This is my project for the January Software Development Level 1 cohort. It is a Team Database that can provide you information about the roster of a fictional team named the Wildcats. There are options to view the entire list of the team and also look at groups of players or individuals based on the data category the user selects. 

 

The special instruction/system requirements to use my application are that it needs to be accessed on a PC or Mac that has .NET 6.0  installed.  

 

The requirements for this project I believe I have met are listed below: 

I created at least one class, then created at least one object of that class and populate it with data. I use and display the data in my application. 
 

I’ve created and called at least 3 functions or methods, at least one returns a value that is used in my application. 

 

I have implemented a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program. 

 

 I have created an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent. 

 

 I have created a dictionary or list, populated it with several values, retrieved at least one value, and used it in my program.
